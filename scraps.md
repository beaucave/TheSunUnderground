The world and rules of this game began, loosely, as a story I started in middle school. In the years since seventh grade, that story has evolved enough that young me might find it unrecognizable. Some things have stayed the same, though: magic is always a ruinous thing, and there are always people who choose to delight in it anyways. There is always a day after the worst day of someone's life.

As I write this, it is November 6, 2024; the day after the United States' 2024 presidential election. I started finally translating the story to a game the day after my one-year-long relationship ended. I think that means something. I'm not sure what.
