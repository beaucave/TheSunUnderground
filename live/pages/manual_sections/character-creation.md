# Character Creation
> [View Identities & Character Sheet](../identities/) 

When creating an Inhabitant, the first thing to select is their Identity. Your identity informs your character’s mindset, and indicates what uses of magic come most naturally to them. Aligned with this, each identity has a primary and secondary color that mirrors their inclinations.

After selecting an identity, you'll select keywords to describe your magic and your conflict ideals. These are narrative guidelines that can inform how your character and their magic acts and reacts during gameplay. 

The last section of the character sheet contains the abilities list and the scars list. Abilities are covered in their own section, while scars are covered in the “Wounds” section. 

## Abilities
> [View Abilities List](../abilities/)

Each character has five abilities total. These abilities guide how you perform magic and interact with your surrounding world. 

The abilities available to you are limited by your Identity. You can pick up to two abilities of your primary color, and up to one ability of your secondary color. You can pick any amount of general abilities.
