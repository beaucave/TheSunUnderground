# Scars

Scars indicate a permanent mutation that you have undergone as a result of your magic overpowering you. They affect how your character perceives the world around them and what theyâ€™re able to do. After you hatch, you may be given a scar by your GM, or you may be the one to decide how your character is changed. 

[i am figuring out how they apply to mechanics, but right now they are roleplay only]
