# Dice Rolls
Dice rolls ensure that everything stays a little unpredictable. The exact timings and contexts for rolls are up to the World, but as a rule of thumb: when you attempt something that could fail, you roll for it. 

Most rolls that you make will have a target: the number you are trying to meet or beat. Easier actions usually have lower targets. Success on a roll correlates generally to proximity to the target; the closer your final value is, the more control you have over what happens. If your final sum is less than the target, it's considered a failure; you do not achieve what you set out to do. 

It is important to note that The Sun Underground is not only about sheer force. In line with this, there are two additional failure mechanics: failure by dearth and failure by excess. 

*Failure by dearth* is the primary failure case. Narratively, this signifies that your attempt couldn't be completed. It makes a problem worse by taking something away (ex. your lock-pick breaks, you don’t catch the ledge, you don’t notice someone behind you). *Failure by excess* is a more special case. If you succeed on a roll by *more than 4*, you've overdone it. You've achieved your goal, but in doing so you've pushed too hard and caused a new problem to fix. These failures introduce something new to the situation (ex. you alert the guards, you hit someone too hard, you lose control of your spell).

**Note:** If you roll doubles, you can roll a second time and choose which value to take. You then apply modifiers as normal (described in [Modifiers](./modifiers)).
