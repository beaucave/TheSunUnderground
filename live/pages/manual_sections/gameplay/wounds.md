# Wounds

Over the course of a game, youâ€™ll take damage. Damage is tracked by your three wound rings: Mundane, Demanding, and Chrysalis. Mundane wounds can be undone by taking active time to tend to them during a scene. Demanding wounds, however, can be undone by specific abilities. Chrysalis wounds can only accrue. 

If you fill a wound ring, any additional damage is passed on to the next highest ring. If you have taken all three Mundane wounds and would take a fourth, you take a new Demanding wound. If you have taken both Demanding wounds and would take a third, you take a Chrysalis wound.

Demanding wounds mechanically reduce your character's ability. When you've taken 1 demanding wound, you cannot apply modifiers to rolls. When you've taken 2 demanding wounds, you drop the lowest value of each dice roll (excluding the rolls of only one die).

In a narrative sense, Demanding wounds are incapacitating.

When you have filled your Chrysalis wounds, you immediately hatch. This begins a new scene. As you play this out, let loose. Act on your ideals, especially the selfish ones. You are more magic than person in this moment; describe how that changes you and what it looks like. Your primary color score is available as an additional modifier to all rolls you make, and you may sum two modifiers from your pool together. 

When your hatching scene is over, clear your wound rings and record a new scar.
