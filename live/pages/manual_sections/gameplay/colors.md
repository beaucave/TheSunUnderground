# Colors
A roll will almost always be one of the four colors: **Red**, **Green**, **Blue**, or **Gold**. 

These colors 

Green rolls are about endurance and confidence. Blue rolls are about momentum and judgement. Red rolls are about change and violence. Gold rolls are about the inhuman: disregarding reality or doing something impossible. Your color scores on your character sheet indicate how many dice you roll for that particular type.
> For example: if you have a Red score of 3, you will roll 3d6 when making a Red roll.
