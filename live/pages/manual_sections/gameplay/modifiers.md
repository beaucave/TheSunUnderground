# Modifiers
You will be asked for many different rolls over the course of a game. Some of these rolls will be within your particular skillset. To reflect this, you have modifiers: numbers that can be added to or subtracted from the rolled number to ensure you succeed.

There are two ways to earn a modifier: as a mid-game surprise or as an ability.

You may deftly navigate a social interaction or land a crucial blow to your enemy's defenses. You'll then earn a modifier that presses that particular advantage. 

However, the more common way to earn modifiers is through Abilities. Abilities provide greater scaffolding to your interactions; anyone can attempt to mend a wound, but a character with the First Aid ability is going to be the most effective. The modifiers granted by abilities will be one of three types: Forward, Reserve, or Backburner. 

Forward modifiers can be applied to the first roll made after earning the modifier. Reserve modifiers can be applied to any roll made after earning the modifier. These two modifiers are both one-time use; after the modifier is applied, you remove it from your character sheet. Backburner modifiers behave differently; these modifiers are available in perpetuity and can be reused. 

Note: by default, you can choose to take the value as rolled and not add modifiers. This may be overridden by the World if you are in harrowing-enough circumstances.
