# The Setting
The Sun Underground intentionally attempts to be setting-agnostic. This system is meant to provide a framework for narrative that can be applied to many different worlds. 

However, there are some things that should remain consistent in any TSU game. They are addressed here.

## Magic
Magic is unknown to the wider world. The average person will know nothing about magic, and will not believe in magic if they are told about it.

This is not an inherent ability. It is transmitted. A person survives an encounter with magic (most commonly with a Shade), and is left with a dormant curse. This dormancy will last for a moment or for years, depending on how their day goes. 

The dormant period invariably ends on the worst day of someoneâ€™s life. This moment is known as their Awakening. The resulting explosion of power is devastating, traumatic, and very often lethal to the caster and anyone in their vicinity. 

Anyone (un)lucky enough to survive their awakening is changed forever. Once they were human, and now they are not. There is no way back.

## Shades
A Shade is the final evolution of a curse. They are monstrous, eldritch creatures that are both incomprehensible and invisible to human eyes. They reside in (and are) their Domains, pocket dimensions existing somewhere between reality and its absence. These spaces bleed into the world and have a tendency to eat people. Portals will open, doors will appear, the floor will disappear, and a person will be in the belly of the beast. 

Shades are also the primary source of curses. In the vast majority of cases, Inhabitants will gain their magic after surviving a Domain. These encounters will inform how your own magic presents; consider specifically what your Inhabitant went through.

It is worth noting that there is no generalization for Shades or their Domains. Two Shades may happen to be similar, but none are identical. This is to say: get creative! A Shade could be a robotic consciousness that exists in a domain of endless cables and spare parts accessed by hitting the wrong button. A Shade could also be a starving animal whose domain is woven into a local forest, where visitors to the forest slip and out of reality as they follow a trail. 

## Detriment
Magic in The Sun Underground is not a good thing. It is not something that creates good; it does not engender community, or kindness, or progress. Magic is a thing to be survived, but not fully escaped. 

Magic is not something that makes you better. Magic is something that you are left with. What you become while having it is up to you. There is no way to go back, but there are many ways to go forward.
