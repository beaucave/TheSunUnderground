## About The Game
The Sun Underground is a game about reality-warping magic and fighting monsters. It is also a game about what happens after your entire world falls apart. 

This game is intended for 3-5 players. One player will act as The World; they are in charge of portraying the people, places, and creatures of your setting. The other players act as Inhabitants; once-humans who have mutated into something else after awakening to magic. It is universally understood that the day someone awoke their magic was the worst day of their life.

To be absolutely clear: this transformation is not a positive experience. But you can find the good in it.

## Consistencies in Setting
The Sun Underground intentionally attempts to be setting-agnostic. This system is meant to provide a framework for narrative that can be applied to many different worlds. 

However, there are some things that should remain consistent in any TSU game. They are addressed here.

### Magic
Magic in The Sun Underground is categorized loosely by color: **Red**, **Green**, **Blue**, or **Gold**. Green magic is about endurance, certainty and calculation. Blue magic is about momentum and judgement. Red magic is about change and violence. Gold magic is about the inhuman: disregarding reality or doing something impossible.

The crux of magic in this world is twofold: it wants to live and it wants to eat. These are not wants in the way that a human would understand them. Magic is not sentient. It does not have motivation; it only has behavior. 

Magic is not an inherent ability. It is transmitted. A person survives an encounter with a Shade, and is left with a dormant curse. This dormancy last for a moment, or for years, depending on how their day goes.

Magic invariably awakens on the worst day of someone’s life. The resulting explosion is devastating, traumatic, and very often lethal to either the caster or anyone in their vicinity. 

Anyone (un)lucky enough to survive their awakening is changed forever. Once they were human, and now they are not. There is no way back.

### Shades
A Shade is the final evolution of a curse. They are monstrous, eldritch creatures that are both incomprehensible and invisible to human eyes. They reside in (and are) their Domains, pocket dimensions existing somewhere between reality and its absence. These spaces bleed into the world and have a tendency to eat people. Portals will open, doors will appear, the floor will disappear, and a person will be in the belly of the beast. 

Shades are also the primary source of curses. In the vast majority of cases, Inhabitants will gain their magic after surviving a Domain. These encounters will inform how your own magic presents; consider specifically what your Inhabitant went through.

It is worth noting that there is no generalization for Shades or their Domains. Two Shades may happen to be similar, but none are identical. This is to say: get creative! A Shade could be a robotic consciousness that exists in a domain of endless cables and spare parts accessed by hitting the wrong button. A Shade could also be a starving animal whose domain is woven into a local forest, where visitors to the forest slip and out of reality as they follow a trail. 

### Lack of Benefit
Magic in The Sun Underground is not a good thing. It is not something that creates good; it does not engender community, or kindness, or progress. Magic is a thing to be survived but not fully escaped. 



Magic is not something that makes you better. Magic is something that you are left with. What you become while having it is up to you. There is no way to go back, but there are many ways to go forward. 

## Character Creation
> [View Identities & Character Sheet](./identities/) 

When creating an Inhabitant, the first thing to select is their Identity. Your identity informs your character’s mindset, and indicates what uses of magic come most naturally to them. Aligned with this, each identity has a primary and secondary color that mirrors their inclinations.

After selecting an identity, you'll select keywords to describe your magic and your conflict ideals. These are narrative guidelines that can inform how your character and their magic acts and reacts during gameplay. 

The last section of the character sheet contains the abilities list and the scars list. Abilities are covered in their own section, while scars are covered in the “Wounds” section. 

### *Abilities*
> [View Abilities List](./abilities/)

Each character has five abilities total. These abilities guide how you perform magic and interact with your surrounding world. 

The abilities available to you are limited by your Identity. You can pick up to two abilities of your primary color, and up to one ability of your secondary color. You can pick any amount of general abilities.

## Gameplay

### *Dice Rolls*
Dice rolls in The Sun Underground ensure that everything stays a little unpredictable. The exact timings and contexts for rolls are up to the World, but as a rule of thumb: when you attempt something that could fail, you roll for it. 

A roll will almost always be one of the four colors: Red, Gold, Green, or Blue. Your color scores on your character sheet indicate how many dice you roll for that particular type.
> For example: if you have a Red score of 3, you will roll 3d6 when making a Red roll.

Most rolls that you make will have a target: the number you are trying to meet or beat. Easier actions usually have lower targets. Success on a roll correlates generally to proximity to the target; the closer your final value is, the more control you have over what happens. If your final sum is less than the target, it's considered a failure; you do not achieve what you set out to do. 

It is important to note that The Sun Underground is not about sheer force, but also about precision. In line with this, there are two additional failure mechanics: failure by dearth and failure by excess. 

**Failure by dearth** is the primary failure case. Narratively, this signifies that your attempt couldn't be completed. It makes a problem worse by taking something away (ex. your lock-pick breaks, you don’t catch the ledge, you don’t notice someone behind you). **Failure by excess** is a more special case. If you succeed on a roll by *more than 4*, you've overdone it. You've achieved your goal, but in doing so you've pushed too hard and caused a new problem to fix. These failures introduce something new to the situation (ex. you alert the guards, you hit someone too hard, you lose control of your spell).

**Note:** If you roll doubles, you can roll a second time and choose which value to take. You then apply modifiers as normal (described below). 

### *Modifiers*
You will be asked for many different rolls over the course of a game. Some of these rolls will be within your particular skillset. To reflect this, you have modifiers: numbers that can be added to or subtracted from the rolled number to ensure you succeed.

There are two ways to earn a modifier: as a mid-game surprise or as an ability.

You may deftly navigate a social interaction or land a crucial blow to your enemy's defenses. You'll then earn a modifier that presses that particular advantage. 

However, the more common way to earn modifiers is through Abilities. Abilities provide greater scaffolding to your interactions; anyone can attempt to mend a wound, but a character with the First Aid ability is going to be the most effective. The modifiers granted by abilities will be one of three types: Forward, Reserve, or Backburner. 

Forward modifiers can be applied to the first roll made after earning the modifier. Reserve modifiers can be applied to any roll made after earning the modifier. These two modifiers are both one-time use; after the modifier is applied, you remove it from your character sheet. Backburner modifiers behave differently; these modifiers are available in perpetuity and can be reused. 

Note: by default, you can choose to take the value as rolled and not add modifiers. This may be overridden by the World if you are in harrowing-enough circumstances.

### *Wounds*

Over the course of a game, you’ll take damage. Damage is tracked by your three wound rings: Mundane, Demanding, and Chrysalis. Mundane wounds can be undone by taking active time to tend to them during a scene. Demanding wounds can be undone by specific abilities. Chrysalis wounds can only accrue. 

If you fill a wound ring, any additional damage is passed on to the next highest ring. If you have taken all three Mundane wounds and would take a fourth, you take a new Demanding wound. If you have taken both Demanding wounds and would take a third, you take a Chrysalis wound.

Demanding wounds are, generally, incapacitating. If you receive a demanding wound, you 

When you have filled your Chrysalis wounds, you immediately hatch. This begins a new scene. As you play this out, let loose. Act on your ideals, especially the selfish ones. You are more magic than person in this moment; describe how that changes you and what it looks like. Your primary color score is available as an additional modifier to all rolls you make, and you may sum two modifiers from your pool together. 

When your hatching scene is over, clear your wound rings and record a new scar. 

### *Scars*

Scars indicate a permanent mutation that you have undergone as a result of your magic overpowering you. They affect how your character perceives the world around them and what they’re able to do. After you hatch, you may be given a scar by your GM, or you may be the one to decide how your character is changed.
