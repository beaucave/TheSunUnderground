## About The Game
The Sun Underground is a game about reality-warping magic and fighting monsters. It is also a game about what happens after your entire world falls apart. 


You play as an Inhabitant — a human who has been irrevocably changed by exposure to magic. This is not a good thing, but it can be made into one. 




## Character Creation
> [View Identities & Character Sheet](./identities/) 

When creating an Inhabitant, the first thing to select is their Identity. Your identity informs your character’s mindset, and indicates what uses of magic come most naturally to them. Aligned with this, each identity has a primary and secondary color that mirrors their inclinations.

After selecting an identity, you'll select keywords to describe your magic and your conflict ideals. These are narrative guidelines that can inform how your character and their magic acts and reacts during gameplay. 

The last section of the character sheet contains the abilities list and the scars list. Abilities are covered in their own section, while scars are covered in the “Wounds” section. 

### *Abilities*
> [View Abilities List](./abilities/)

Each character has five abilities total. These abilities guide how you perform magic and interact with your surrounding world. 

The abilities available to you are limited by your Identity. You can pick up to two abilities of your primary color, and up to one ability of your secondary color. You can pick any amount of general abilities.

## Gameplay

### *Dice Rolls*

When you make a roll, you have a target number. The closer you are to your target, the more control you have over what happens. Easier actions have more common targets. 

Failure by exceeding the target is different to failure by not reaching it. Failing under the target makes a problem worse by taking something away (your lock-pick breaks, you don’t catch the ledge, you don’t notice someone behind you). Failing over the target introduces something new (you alert the guards, you hit someone too hard, you lose control of your spell).

If you roll doubles, you can roll a second time and choose which value to take.

- Failure: 3+ numbers away
- Partial success: 2 numbers away
- Success: within 1 number
    - Overwhelming Success: you roll the exact number

**For example...**
> - target = 6
> - failure: sum to 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 11, 12
> - partial success: sum to 4, 8
> - success: sum to 5, 6, 7
> - critical success: roll a 6

A roll will be one of four types, depending on the situation: Red, Blue, Green, or Gold. 

Green rolls are about endurance and calculation. Blue rolls are about momentum and judgement. Red rolls are about change and violence. Gold rolls are about the inhuman: disregarding reality or doing something impossible.

### *Modifiers*

When you are asked for a specific roll, you can use your corresponding color score as a modifier to increase or decrease the total and be closer to the target. 

Some curses will grant you additional modifiers. These can be noted on your character sheet, and become part of your modifier pool for that roll type or circumstance. When making a roll with a modifier pool, you can choose to swap out the requested modifier for one in your pool. 

You cannot sum modifiers without the **Give Everything** ability.

You can choose to take the value as rolled and not add modifiers.

### *Wounds*

Over the course of a game, you’ll take damage. Damage is tracked by your three wound rings: Mundane, Demanding, and Chrysalis. Mundane wounds can be undone by taking active time to tend to them during a scene. Demanding wounds can be undone by specific abilities. Chrysalis wounds can only accrue. 

If you fill a wound ring, any additional damage is passed on to the next highest ring. If you have taken all three Mundane wounds and would take a fourth, you take a new Demanding wound. If you have taken both Demanding wounds and would take a third, you take a Chrysalis wound.

Demanding wounds are, generally, incapacitating. If you receive a demanding wound, you 

When you have filled your Chrysalis wounds, you immediately hatch. This begins a new scene. As you play this out, let loose. Act on your ideals, especially the selfish ones. You are more magic than person in this moment; describe how that changes you and what it looks like. Your primary color score is available as an additional modifier to all rolls you make, and you may sum two modifiers from your pool together. 

When your hatching scene is over, clear your wound rings and record a new scar. 

### *Scars*

Scars indicate a permanent mutation that you have undergone as a result of your magic overpowering you. They affect how your character perceives the world around them and what they’re able to do. After you hatch, you may be given a scar by your GM, or you may be the one to decide how your character is changed.
