- oz
- monsterhearts: darkest self
- wildsea: milestones & milestone projects
- absurdia: bonds, friends/rivals
- absurdia: questions/agendas
 - questions and agendas -> 
- kids on brooms: excess/overthrow mechanics
- candela obscura: dice pool mechanics

- questions are like... the starting point for the character arc. it's the conflict, it's the... what are you trying to get out of this? non-identity specific
- questions: past/present, future
    - past/present:
        - describe your first encounter with magic. 
        - describe your awakening. why was this the worst day of your life?
        - 
    - future:
        - what are you leaving behind?
        - what are you hiding from? 
        - what is getting worse?
        - what are you fighting?

- questions need to be re-answered upon hatching/scarring/completing an agenda/finishing a chapter
- 
- horizontal progression: instead of trying to minmax optimize a build, you're trying to expand a build; it's not about making the stats go up, it's unlocking a new skill tree branch
    - what is unlocking a new skill tree branch when you don't modify your existing stats?
    - stella doloris tiers of abilities
        - three tiers per ability. 1, 2, 3.
        - each ability gives you an additional modifier for a specific roll situation (roll type and roll situation -- different things. official vocab?). 
        - ability categories: general, colorful (rgba), special
            - general: obvious. add some weapons ones?
            - special: The Indomitable Human Spirit, Sanctuary, 
            - attributes of an ability: name, tier 1 description, tier 2 description, tier 3 description, category

- You always roll at least 1d6. Additional dice are determined by your stats; if you have a Red score of 2, you roll two more dice (3d6 in total) when making Red rolls. Add or subtract modifiers sticks around; instead of changing targets it changes the modifiers.
    - tier 1: forward modifier, modifier of 1, 
    - tier 2: reserve, modifier 2, 
    - tier 3: backburner, modifier of 3, 
- 
- failure by excess: roll more than 5 over the DC
- fail: roll under the DC
- failure by deficit: roll more than 5 under the DC
